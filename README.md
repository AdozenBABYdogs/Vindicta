# Project_0.Stratis

**What is it?**
It is a mission for ARMA III. The goal of this project is to make a guerrilla warfare simulator for ARMA III, hugely influenced by a similar mission by Barbolani: Antistasi (http://www.a3antistasi.com/).

**Goals of this project**
* Most of the features of the original Antistasi.
* Proper operation of logistics of the enemy and friendly factions.
* Enemy high command more responsive to player's actions.

**Current state of development**
Some mainly structural things are implemented, like garrison caching, location spawning/despawning and some scripts for AI. Other than that, there's not much to look at here.
