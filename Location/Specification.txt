Location holds data of a specific place like base, roadblock or anything of that kind that has a position and various units assigned to it.

A location should solve these tasks:
When to spawn or despawn the garrison associated with it?
What positions are available for spawning vehicles, helicopters, planes, infantry? We should be able to define these positions both manually and procedurally.

Location needs to do these things:

Initialize its garrison.

Check conditions for spawning/despawning garrison (conditions are yet to be determined).

Spawn and despawn its garrison.

A location should be able to split its garrison in order to provide support to another location, for example, to send a QRF somewhere or to send supplies somewhere.

A location shouldn't care when to provide support or QRF, it should receive such commands from another higher entity such as a commander.
